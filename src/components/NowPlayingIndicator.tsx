/**
 * Animated EQ-bars indicator for the currently-playing track.
 *
 * Renders N vertical bars (default 4) that bounce between a low and a
 * high height on slightly-different periods, producing a classic "music
 * visualiser" look that signals "this is the active track" without
 * occluding the cover art behind it.
 *
 * Animation is paused when the host playerStore reports a non-playing
 * state — the bars freeze at their current height rather than vanishing,
 * so a paused track still reads as "the active one".
 *
 * Each bar's animation runs on the native (UI) thread via Reanimated, so
 * the indicator does not impact JS thread responsiveness when many rows
 * are mounted (e.g. scrolling an album with the active track on screen).
