/**
 * Stale-song-ID recovery (#146).
 *
 * Subsonic servers can change a song's internal ID under our feet —
 * the most common triggers are a Navidrome rescan, a database
 * migration, a file replacement (mp3 → flac), or an octo-fiesta-style
 * proxy "permanentising" a previously-virtual external track into a
 * proper library entry. Substreamer treats `cached_songs` /
 * `song_index` / `album_details` as authoritative once populated, so
 * the dead IDs linger and every subsequent stream call 404s.
 *
 * This service runs when playback fails. It:
 *
 *  1. Snapshots the cached album's song list (so we know the OLD ids).
 *  2. Calls `albumDetailStore.fetchAlbum(albumId)` to refresh the
 *     server's current view — this overwrites `album_details` AND
 *     `song_index` for the whole album in one shot (see
 *     `detailTables.upsertSongsForAlbum`, which DELETEs every old row
 *     for the album before inserting fresh ones).
 *  3. Diffs OLD vs FRESH song lists to build a per-album `{oldId →
 *     freshChild}` swap map. The premise: if one ID went stale, others
 *     in the same album probably did too (same rescan, same file move).
 *  4. For each swap that targets a DOWNLOADED song:
 *     - renames the file on disk (`renameCachedSongFile`)
 *     - rewrites the `cached_songs` row + `cached_item_songs` edges
 *       via `remapCachedSongId`.
 *  5. Returns the fresh `Child` for the currently-failing song plus
 *     the full swap map, so the caller (playerService) can update its
 *     in-memory queue + the native RNTP track.
 *
 * If the album refresh comes back with the SAME ID for the failing
 * song, the recovery exits with `null` — there's nothing to swap and
 * the original PlaybackError was a transient blip the normal retry
 * path can handle.
