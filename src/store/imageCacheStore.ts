/**
 * Zustand store exposing the image-cache aggregate state held by the

 *
 * The old version of this store persisted its own totalBytes/fileCount
 * aggregates via `persist(createJSONStorage(kvStorage))`. Those are now
 * derived from SQL on every launch via `hydrateFromDb()` and kept in sync
 * by service-layer callers invoking `recalculateFromDb()` after any
 * variant write or delete. `fileCount` used to double as both "files on
 * disk" and "logical images" — we now expose both explicitly plus a
 * count of covers that are missing one or more variants.
 *
 * `maxConcurrentImageDownloads` is a user setting, not cache state, so it
 * lives in a separate tiny KV blob (`substreamer-image-cache-settings`),
 * same pattern as `musicCacheStore`.
