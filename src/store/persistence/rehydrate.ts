/**
 * Single entry point for rehydrating every per-row SQLite-backed Zustand
 * store. Each store hydrates in its own try/catch so a corrupt row in one
 * store cannot block the others from loading; the caller receives a
 * structured result describing which succeeded and which failed.
 *
 * Called from exactly two sites: the `rehydrated && isLoggedIn` useEffect
 * in `src/app/_layout.tsx` and the splash post-migration callback in
 * `src/components/AnimatedSplashScreen.tsx`. Both calls are idempotent —
 * each store's `hydrateFromDb()` re-reads the current SQL state and
 * replaces its in-memory mirror, safe under our write-through semantics.
 *
 * Each store hydrates independently — no FK-style dependency between them —
 * so they run **concurrently** via `Promise.all`. The per-store SQLite reads
 * (`getAllAsync`/`getFirstAsync`) execute on expo-sqlite's background IO
 * thread, and the JS-side JSON.parse / row-mapping is chunked with
 * `setTimeout(0)` yields inside each `hydrateFromDbAsync`, so boot hydration
 * never blocks the JS thread for long even on a large library. Concurrent
 * reads queue on the native IO dispatcher; correctness is unaffected because
 * each store writes only its own slice of state.
 *
 * Each store hydrates in its own try/catch so a corrupt row in one store
 * cannot block the others; the caller receives a structured result.
 *
 * **Not exported from `./index.ts`.** This module imports stores; stores
 * import from `./index.ts` for table helpers. Re-exporting here would
 * create a cycle. Consumers import directly from
 * `'../store/persistence/rehydrate'`.
 *
 * kvStorage-backed stores (favorites, ratings, theme, etc.) aren't covered
 * by this helper — Zustand's `persist` middleware auto-rehydrates them on
 * store creation.
